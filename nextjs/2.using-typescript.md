# How to using TypeScript with Next.js

## Create file (empty)

```bash
cd code/next-ts
touch tsconfig.json
```

## Running but Error!

```bash
yarn dev
```

```bash
ready - started server on http://localhost:3000
It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
````

## Solved via install package for TypeScript

```bash
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

## Running Again

```bash
yarn dev
```

```bash
ready - started server on http://localhost:3000
We detected TypeScript in your project and created a tsconfig.json file for you.

event - compiled successfully
```

## Most important!

Change extension file of `.js` to `.tsx` and funny!

In current this case:

- `pages/index.js` to `pages/index.tsx`
- `pages/api/hello.js` to `pages/api/hello.tsx`
