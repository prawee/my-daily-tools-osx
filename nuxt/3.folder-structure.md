## Structure

### Folder

```bash
- assets        # This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS or Javascript. **(not required)
- components    # This components directory contains your Vue.js components. **(not required)
- layouts       # This directory contains your Application Layouts. **(not required)
- middleware    # This directory contains your application middleware. Middleware let you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages. **(not required)
- pages         # This directory contains your Application Views and Routes. The framework reads all the *.vue files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.
- plugins       # This directory contains Javascript plugins that you want to run before mounting the root Vue.js application. **(not required)
- static        # This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`. This you'd want to delete this READEME.md before deploying to production. Exp. /static/robots.txt is mapped as /robots.txt. **(not required)
- store         # This directory contains your Vuex Store files. Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.
