 === Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: 
❯ Use an existing project 
  Create a new project 
  Add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud Platform project 
  Don't set up a default project 
```

```bash
? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: (Use arrow keys)
❯ your-project (your-project) 
```

```bash
=== Functions Setup

A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? 
  JavaScript 
❯ TypeScript
```

```bash
? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? TypeScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
✔  Wrote functions/package.json
✔  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
✔  Wrote functions/tsconfig.json
✔  Wrote functions/tsconfig.dev.json
✔  Wrote functions/src/index.ts
✔  Wrote functions/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? (Y/n) Y
```

```bash
=== Storage Setup

Firebase Storage Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
uploads and downloads. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Storage Rules? (storage.rules)
```

```bash
i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!
```
